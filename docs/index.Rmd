# What is parallel processing?

### Benefit: task speedup

More of your computer's resources used -> Multiple computations run at the same time -> less overall time needed

---

# What is parallel processing?

--

### Some jargon

- A **core** is the part of your computer's processor that performs computations
  
  - Most modern computers have >1 core

--
  
- A **process** is a single running task or program (like R) - each core runs one process at a time
  
--

- A **cluster** typically refers to a network of computers that work together (each with many cores), but it can also mean the collection of cores on your personal computer

# When to use parallel processing

# When to use parallel processing

When tasks are **pleasingly parallel**, i.e. if your analysis could easily be separated into many identical but separate tasks that do not rely on one another

Examples:

- Bootstrapping
- Monte Carlo simulations
- Machine learning (e.g., cross-validation, model selection, hyperparameter tuning, models like random forests that can run in parallel)
- Computations by group

--

Parallel processing is not effective with something like:

```{r, eval = FALSE}
function(a) {
  b <- a + 1
  c <- b + 2
  d <- c + 3
  return(d)
}
```

where each step depends on the one before it, so they cannot be completed at the same time.

### As a first step, always **profile** your code.

--

> 1. Find the biggest bottleneck (the slowest part of your code).
> 2. Try to eliminate it (you may not succeed but that’s ok).
> 3. Repeat until your code is “fast enough.”

### A few suggestions:

- Embrace vectorization 
- Use functional programming: the `apply` (base) or `map` (`purrr` package) functions 
- Test out different packages: the `data.table` world is significantly faster than the `tidyverse`

# Caveats and things to keep in mind

- Implementation varies across operating systems

  - Two ways that code can be parallelized: **forking** vs **sockets**
  - **Forking** is faster, but doesn't work on Windows and may cause problems in IDEs like RStudio
  - **Sockets** are a bit slower, but work across operating systems and in IDEs
  
  
--
  
- Debugging can be tricky

--

- Be careful when generating random numbers across processes (R has some [strategies](https://www.r-bloggers.com/2020/09/future-1-19-1-making-sure-proper-random-numbers-are-produced-in-parallel-processing/) to deal with this)

# R packages for parallelization

### There are numerous approaches for parallelizing code in R.

--

1. The `parallel` package is a built-in base R package
2. The `future` package is newer and a bit friendlier (**recommended**)

Many different R packages for parallel processing exist, but they leverage either `parallel` or `future` as a *backend*, or both (and let us decide which to use).

---

# R packages for parallelization

Today's demo will use `furrr` (which uses `future`). 

`furrr` is the parallel version of `purrr` and contains near drop-in replacements for `purrr`'s family of `map()` and `walk()` functions.

```{r echo = FALSE}
data.frame(purrr = c("`map()`", "`map_df()`", "`map_chr()`", "`map2()`", "`pmap()`", "`walk()`", "`walk2()`"),
           furrr = c("`future_map()`", "`future_map_dfr()`", "`future_map_chr()`", "`future_map2()`", "`future_pmap()`", "`future_walk()`", "`future_walk2()`")) |> 
  knitr::kable()
```

# R packages for parallelization

See slides at the end of this presentation for brief comparisons of serial vs. parallel code within the following R packages:

- `parallel`
- `dopar` (can use `parallel` or `future`)
- `furrr` (uses `future`)
- `future.apply` (uses `future`)

...but there are many others

- Check out [multidplyr](https://github.com/tidyverse/multidplyr)

# Appendix <br> 
### Serial vs. parallel code in common R packages for parallel computation

---

# The [`parallel`](https://stat.ethz.ch/R-manual/R-devel/library/parallel/doc/parallel.pdf) package

**Purpose:** parallel versions of apply functions. This package is a part of core R and thus you do not need to install it. Note that it is operating system dependent.

Unix/Linux (forking): 
```{r eval = FALSE}
# Serial
lapply(1:10, sqrt)

# Parallel
mclapply(1:10, sqrt, mc.cores = 4) # Specify 4 cores
```


--

&zwj;Windows (sockets):

```{r eval = FALSE}
# Serial
lapply(1:10, sqrt)

# Parallel 
cluster <- makePSOCKcluster(4) # Specify 4 cores
parLapply(cluster, 1:10, sqrt)
```

.footnote[
<sup>1</sup> Disclaimer: The code on this and the following slides would never be parallelized in practice - they are just examples to highlight package syntax.
]

---

# The [`foreach`](https://github.com/RevolutionAnalytics/foreach) package

**Purpose:** allows you to use `for` loops in parallel and choose your backend (e.g. `parallel` vs. `future`)

```{r eval = FALSE}
# Serial
for(i in 1:10) print(sqrt(i))

# Parallel 
cluster <- makeCluster(4) # Specify 4 cores
doParallel::registerDoParallel(cluster) # using {parallel} backend
foreach(i = 1:10) %dopar% {
  sqrt(i)
}
cluster <- makeCluster(4) # Specify 4 cores
doFuture::registerDoFuture(cluster) # using {future} backend
foreach(i = 1:10) %dopar% {
  sqrt(i)
}
```

---

# The [`furrr`](https://github.com/DavisVaughan/furrr) package

**Purpose:** parallel versions of `purrr::map()` functions using futures

```{r, eval = FALSE}
# Serial
map_dbl(1:10, sqrt)

# Parallel
plan(multisession)
future_map_dbl(1:10, sqrt)
```

---

# The [`future.apply`](https://github.com/HenrikBengtsson/future.apply) package

**Purpose:** parallel versions of `apply()` functions using futures

```{r eval = FALSE}
# Serial
lapply(1:10, sqrt)

# Parallel 
plan(multisession)
future_lapply(1:10, sqrt)
```
